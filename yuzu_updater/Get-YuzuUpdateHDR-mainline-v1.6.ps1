#Author - Nothing Loud/lionellion/ /u/Ok_Excitement5874
#Credits - Heavily inspired/borrowed code from /u/Takia_Gecko
#Special Thanks - Google Bard for helping with debugging and revising some code
#Use: This code automatically manages, backs-up, and updates your yuzu folders every time you run it. 
#Plus it auto-launches the latest yuzu from the official github and it even renames/converts your files to trigger Auto-HDR in Windows 11!
#If your yuzu is fully updated, then it checks that the files and folders are properly arranged and auto-launches Auto-HDR-capable yuzu.
#I wrote this myself. It may trigger virus software because it is unsigned. However, as you can see from the code below, there is nothing harmful to your system!
#Enjoy! :)
