# yuzu mainline OFFICIAL build - HDR/backup/Reshade manager/updater software
Public coding/software projects related to video gaming and emulation with open-source Yuzu and Yuzu Early Action (EA).

This software hands-off, automatically updates your yuzu official mainline build package and folders, creating user-specified number of automatic backups, and launching the latest version of yuzu in auto-HDR (or not, if desired). It also automatically detects and manages Reshade installations.
